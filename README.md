# MultiAssetReturnPrediction
A project completed at UC Berkeley under supervision of Dr Ali Kakhbod. The goal of this project was to understand feature importance across different asset classes, and to build a multi-factor model that achieves reasonable return predictions. Our team consisted of Ajay Kumar, Rohit Chaturvedi, Gurmeet Bedi, Rishi Kumra and Sudhansh Dua.
